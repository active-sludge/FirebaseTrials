# SWE590 Term Project

Mobile development is very popular these days. However, firing up an app requires not only a front-end, also a robust back-end. With the power of emerging  cloud technologies, ready to use backend services and APIs are at the use of mobile developers. Google has developed a good amount of API to set up a full backend for any mobile app to use. These APIs include database, analytic tools, authentication, and much more. In this project, I will develop an iOS app to showcase some of these features of Firebase.


## Features
• Analytics: Tracks what’s happening inside the app.

• Real Time Database: Basic database.

• Firestore Database: Advanced database.

• Remote Config: Change app behavior without a need of a release.

• Authentication: User register and login.

• Crashlytics: Crash data collections and metrics.
